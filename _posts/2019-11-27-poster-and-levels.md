This week, I worked on designing my poster for the end-of-semester design expo that I'll be presenting this game at. I also made more levels, fixed bugs, and formalized the game logic more. Blog post is brief, because the work has been focused and pointed.

## Game Changes/Bugfixes

* I've decided that for every level, the behavior of an instrument's numbers is consistent (e.g. bass drum always 10 on center, 5 on outside).
* Fixed bugs with muting the metronome not working
* You can now mute all game audio during a level.
* When a tutorial popup is up, the level itself is not visible.

## Levels

In order, the levels are now:

- Bass Drum on 1 and 3
- Bass Drum on 1 and 3, but neighbor numbers get subtracted
- Bass 1 and 3, Snare 2 and 4
- 6/8 waltz feel
- some 4/4 cool thing idk what its called
- a 3:2 polyrhythm!
- boots and cats

## Poster Design

I started designing the poster! You can preview the poster [here](/assets/PosterDraft.pdf).


## Android Build... Probably Not, For Now

I tried to set up Unity for Android builds and was met with my computer crashing. An hour or so of debugging didn't really help so I decided to instead build for WebGL.

## Progress Build

Instead of a video, you can play an in-progress version of the game!

## Next Steps

* Last set of levels. I want to be at 14 levels when the semester ends!
